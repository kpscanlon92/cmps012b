Grader:  copy this file into the student's submit directory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Run mk.build

(3) Checksource did not complain.  If it did, deduct 1 point
    (max 3) for each DIFFERENT kind of complaint.

Look for the following items to see if the Java was converted
properly into C.

(3) do_binop and do_operator used a switch statement to select
    operators.

(3) push function correctly translated

(3) err_operator do_print and do_clear properly implemented

(3) general formatting and indentation is neat and readable

source total=
min 1, max 15

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Run mk.test

For each of the three test runs, did the output look like
the output from running jrpn in the code directory?
Assign 0..4 points depending on how closely the output matched.
Ignore minor differences in number formatting like a trailing
0 or not.

(3) the script mk worked and produced an executable.
    otherwise compile by hand and run the tests.

(3) test1.output

(3) test2.output (error messages and invalid operators)

(3) test3.output

(3) All of the tests ran to completion and none of them
    crashed with a segmentation fault message.  Deduct all
    3 points for this item if any of the runs crashed.

testing total=
min 0, max 15

-----------------------------------------------------------------

add source total to testing total, giving:
SUBTOTAL=
min 1, max 30

If pair programming, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL - TOTAL2.
If not, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL.

TOTALSCORE=
min 1, max 30
