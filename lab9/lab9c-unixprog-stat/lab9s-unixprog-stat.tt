1.  Overview

In this lab you will be introduced to a simple Unix systems
programming problem, namely printing out statistics about files.  We
present the program in the form of a Unix man(1) page.  You will also
need to read man pages as listed.

NAME
     l9stat -- stat a list of files

SYNOPSIS
     l9stat [filename...]

DESCRIPTION
     Each argument is a filename whose statistics are to be printed.
     If no filenames are given, the current directory (.) is used.
     For each file, print the mode, the file size in bytes , the file
     or link modification time, and the name.  If a file is a symbolic
     link, the value of the link is also printed.  If the time is more
     than 180 days from the current time, the month, day, and year are
     printed, otherwise, the month, day, and time.

EXIT STATUS

     0    No errors were detected.

     1    Errors were detected and messages printed.

SEE ALSO
     ls(1), man(1), stat(1), lstat(2), readlink(2), time(2),
     localtime(3), strerror(3), strftime(3).

2.  Notes

To prepare for writing this lab, read several man(1) pages which
describe the system calls and library functions you need to use.  The
number in parentheses indicates the chapter:  (1) User commands, (2)
System calls, and (3) C library functions.

(\alpha) The commands ls(1) and stat(1) show information about files.
     The Perl program l9stat.perl is a reference implementation, and
     your program should produce the same output.

(\beta) Manual pages can be read using the man(1) command.  Each man
     page is in a particular section, so, for example, the command
        man -s 3 printf
     can display the man page for printf(3).  The number in
     parentheses indicates the manual section.

(\gamma) You may use the x command from /afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/
     cmps012b-wm/bin (in your path) to display a man page in a new
     xterm:
        x man -s 3 printf &

(\delta) The system call lstat(2) provides information about a file
     (or a link, if it is a link).  The information is in a struct
     stat, and you will use the fields st_mode, st_size, and st_mtime.
     The mode is printed as 6 octal digits, and the size as 9 decimal
     digits.

(\epsilon) If lstat fails, print an error message in the standard
     format and continue.

(\zeta) The system call readlink(2) will return information about the
     symbolic link, if the file is a symbolic link.  If it fails,
     assume that the file is not a symlink and ignore the failure.

(\eta) The system call time(2) returns the current time in seconds
     since the Epoch (Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 1970 UTC) as a value of type
     time_t.

(\theta) The C library function localtime(3) accepts a value of type
     time_t, and using the local time, formats it into a struct tm
     suitable for printing.

(\iota) The C library function strerror(3) accepts the variable errno
     and returns a suitable formatted string indicating a reason for a
     failed system call.

(\kappa) The C library function strftime(3) accepts a format string
     and a struct tm and returns a string suitable for printing.  Use
     the format string "%b_%e_%R" if the time is within 180 days of
     the current time (whether in the past or in the future) and
     "%b_%e__%Y" if beyond that time.  The symbol ``_'' is a visible
     space, which you should type into your program as an ordinary
     space.

3.  What to submit

Submit README, Makefile, l9stat.c.  Your Makefile must build an
executable binary called l9stat.  Also, if you are doing pair
programming, submit the required pair programming files.
