Yes, it is OK if you copy these files for this trivial
assignment.  Not everyone will notice this hidden directory.  It
does not show up from a browser or with ls without the -a
option.  Just another advantange of using the Unix command line
directly without wasting time with that pointy clicky nonsense.
