#NAME
#     jgrep -- search files for a pattern
#
#SYNOPSIS
#     jgrep [-ilnv] pattern [filename...]
#
#DESCRIPTION
#     The jgrep utility searches text files for a pattern and prints
#     out all lines that match that pattern.  Patterns are specified as
#     regular expressions and make use of java.util.regex.Pattern.
#
#OPTIONS
#     The options word must be the first word and begin with a minus
#     sign (-) if present.  Option letters in the options word may
#     occur in any order.  Operands appear thereafter.
#
#     -i   Ignore upper- and lower-case distinctions in the specified
#          pattern.
#
#     -l   Prints only the names of the files with matching lines, one
#          filename per line.  A filename is printed only once.
#
#     -n   Precede each line by its line number within the file, with
#          the first line being line 1.
#
#     -v   Prints all lines except for those that match the pattern.
#          The sense of the match is complemented.
#
#OPERANDS
#     The first operand is required and is a regular expression
#     according to the syntax recognized by the java.util.regex.Pattern
#     class.  All other operands are filenames.  Each file is opened
#     for input in turn.  if no filenames are specified, then stdin is
#     read instead.
#
#EXIT STATUS
#     The following exit status values are returned when the program
#     exits:
#
#     0    One or more matches were found.
#
#     1    No matches were found.
#
#     2    Syntax errors or inaccessible files were found.
